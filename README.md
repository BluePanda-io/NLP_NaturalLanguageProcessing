# NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing
Working with NLTK which is a python library for Natural Language Processing and DataMining

## What was developed in this project
In this project we create multiple Natural Language Processing files, focusing on the basics of Language processing like:
1. Tokenization
2. Stemming
3. Lemmatization
4. POS tags
5. Named Entity Recognition
6. Chinking 

# Also Machine Learning Models were developed 
The above preprocessing was used to recognize the sentiment of Tweets and movie reviews
